abstract: "Autonomous robots combine a variety of skills to form increasingly
complex behaviors called missions. While the skills are often
programmed at a relatively low level of abstraction, their
coordination is architecturally separated and often expressed in
higher-level languages or frameworks.  Recently, the language of
Behavior Trees gained attention among roboticists for this
reason. Originally designed for computer games to model autonomous
actors, Behavior Trees offer an extensible tree-based representation
of missions. However, even though, several implementations of the
language are in use, little is known about its usage and scope in the
real world. How do behavior trees relate to traditional languages for
describing behavior? How are behavior-tree concepts used in
applications? What are the benefits of using them?<br><br>

We present a study of the key language concepts in Behavior Trees and
their use in real-world robotic applications. We identify behavior
tree languages and compare their semantics to the most well-known
behavior modeling languages: state and activity diagrams. We mine open
source repositories for robotics applications that use the language
and analyze this usage. We find that Behavior Trees are a pragmatic
language, not fully specified, allowing projects to extend it even for
just one model. Behavior trees clearly resemble the models-at-runtime
paradigm. We contribute a dataset of realworld behavior models, hoping
to inspire the community to use and further develop this language,
associated tools, and analysis techniques."
