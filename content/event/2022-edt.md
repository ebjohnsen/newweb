summary: Invited talk, Engineering Digital Twins Seminar Series
abstract: Digital twins are emerging as an engineering paradigm to build software centred around models of physical objects or processes, with very diverse application domains. The purpose of a digital twin is to understand, predict and act on the behaviour of these physical systems. In engineering, the use of digital twins profoundly changes the management of the entire product lifecycle, from design to manufacturing and operations, because the digital twins adapt in response to the evolution of their physical counterpart. In this talk, we discuss digital twins from the perspective of behavioural models. We share some ideas about model evolution in digital twins from this perspective, tell you about our current research activities on digital twins at the University of Oslo, and discuss some ensuing research challenges at the intersection of formal methods and software engineering.

**Abstract.** <br>
Digital twins are emerging as an engineering paradigm to build
software centred around models of physical objects or processes, with
very diverse application domains. The purpose of a digital twin is to
understand, predict and act on the behaviour of these physical
systems. In engineering, the use of digital twins profoundly changes
the management of the entire product lifecycle, from design to
manufacturing and operations, because the digital twins adapt in
response to the evolution of their physical counterpart. In this talk,
we discuss digital twins from the perspective of behavioural
models. We share some ideas about model evolution in digital twins
from this perspective, tell you about our current research activities
on digital twins at the University of Oslo, and discuss some ensuing
research challenges at the intersection of formal methods and software
engineering.

**Bio.** <br> 
Einar Broch Johnsen is a professor and the head of the Formal Methods
group at the Department of Informatics, University of Oslo. His
research interests include programming models and methodology; system
specification and modeling; and the theory and application of formal
methods. He is active in formal methods for distributed and concurrent
systems, including object-oriented and concurrent languages, manycore
computing, cloud computing, and digital twins. He is one of the main
developers of the ABS modeling language. Homepage:
