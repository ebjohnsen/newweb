HATS was a four-year FET project funded under the EU's FP7 programme
2010-2013 (project no 231620).  CORDIS website [here](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/231620).

In the project, we propose to take an
empirically successful, yet informal software development paradigm and
put it on a formal basis. Specifically, in HATS we will turn software
product family (SWPF) development into a rigorous approach. The
technical core of the project is an Abstract Behavioral Specification
language which will allow precise description of SWPF features and
components and their instances. The main project outcome is a
methodological and tool framework achieving not merely far-reaching
automation in maintaining dynamically evolving software, but an
unprecedented level of trust while informal processes are replaced
with rigorous analyses based on formal semantics.
