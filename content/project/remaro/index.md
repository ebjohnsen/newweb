Remaro is a Marie Skłodowska-Curie (MSCA) European Training Network
funded by the European Commission 2020-2024 (project no 956200). CORDIS website [here](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/956200).

The network will educate 15 PhD research fellows on complimentary
aspects of reliable autonomy for underwater robotic applications. The
REMARO research fellows will develop the first ever submarine robotics
AI methods with quantified reliability, correctness specifications,
models, tests, and analysis & verification methods.
