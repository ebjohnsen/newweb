summary: The Faculty of Natural Sciences' Sustainability Seminar
abstract: "We discuss ideas underlying a collaboration with [Atle
Jensen](https://www.mn.uio.no/math/english/people/aca/atlej/index.html)
([Math, UiO](https://www.mn.uio.no/math/english/)) and [Kai
H. Christensen](https://www.mn.uio.no/geo/english/people/aca/metos/kaihc/index.html)
and [Jean Rabault](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeanrabault/?originalSubdomain=no) ([MET](https://www.met.no/en)) on constructing a data-driven model to analyse the effect of extreme weather on the
circulation model for the Oslo fjord. We will build a digital twin to
model this problem, which couples hydrodynamical models of river floods, fjord circulation models and sensor data from custom built drifters."
