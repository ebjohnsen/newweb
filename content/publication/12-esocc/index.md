abstract: "We show how aspects of performance, resource consumption, and deployment on the cloud can be formally modeled for an industrial case study of a distributed system, using the abstract behavioral specification language ABS. These non-functional aspects are integrated with an existing formal model of the functional system behavior, supporting a separation of concerns between the functional and non-functional aspects in the integrated model. The ABS model is parameterized with respect to deployment scenarios which capture different application-level management policies for virtualized resources. The model is validated against the existing system’s performance characteristics and used to simulate and compare deployment scenarios on the cloud."
