UpScale was an EU FP7 FET Open-X research project 2014-2017 (project
no 612985).  CORDIS website [here](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/612985).

The idea was to design programming languages for the
manycore era, when a program can make use of potentially millions of
processors. UpScale used incremental type-based program annotations
specifying deployment-related information, and for innovative
type-based deployment optimisations both at compile- and runtime. The
Encore language was designed in this project.
