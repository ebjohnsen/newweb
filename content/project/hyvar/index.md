HyVar was an EU H2020 research project 2015-2018 (project no
644298). I was the scientific coordinator of HyVar.
CORDIS website [here](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/644298).

The idea was to develop a framework for continuous software evolution in distributed systems which combines the description of evolution as a software product line, a scalable cloud infrastructure to monitoring and customization of software upgrades for remote devices, and over-the-air upgrade technologies.
