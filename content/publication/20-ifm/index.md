abstract: "  Active objects extend the Actor paradigm with structured
  communication using method calls and futures.  Active objects are,
  like actors, known to be data race free. Both are inherently
  concurrent, as they share a fundamental decoupling of communication
  and synchronisation. Both encapsulate their state, restricting
  access to one process at a time. Clearly, this rules out low-level
  races between two processes accessing a shared variable. But is that
  sufficient to guarantee deterministic results from the execution of
  an active object program?

  In this paper we are interested in so-called high-level races caused
  by the fact that the arrival order of messages between active
  objects can be non-deterministic, resulting in non-deterministic
  overall behaviour. We study this problem in the setting of a core
  calculus and identify restrictions on active object programs which
  are sufficient to guarantee deterministic behaviour for active object
  programs. We formalise these restrictions as a simple extension to
  the type system of the calculus and prove that well-typed programs
  exhibit deterministic behaviour."
