abstract: "Current  object-oriented  approaches  to  distributed  programs may be criticized in several respects. First, method calls are generally synchronous, which leads to much waiting in distributed and unstable networks. Second, the common model of thread concurrency makes reasoning about program behavior very challenging. A model based on concurrent objects communicating by means of asynchronous method calls has been proposed to combine object orientation and distribution in a more satisfactory way. This paper  introduces  a  reasoning  system  for  this  model,  focusing on simplicity and modularity. We believe that a simple and compositional proof system is paramount to allow verification of real programs. The proposed proof rules are derived  from  the  Hoare  rules  of  a  standard  sequential  language by means of a semantic encoding preserving soundness and relative completeness."
