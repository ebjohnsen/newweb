Envisage was an  EU FP7 research project 2013-2016 (project no 610582).
I was the coordinator of Envisage.  CORDIS website [here](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/610582).

The basic idea was to integrate service-level agreements (SLA) into the interfaces of an object-oriented model and validate SLA for cloud computing at design time using formal methods. The Envisage project delivered novel methods for predicting the behavior of software deployed on the cloud, using formal models and analysis techniques.
