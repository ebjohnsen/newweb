abstract: "Software engineering increasingly emphasizes variability by developing families of products for a range of application contexts or user requirements. ABS is a modeling language which supports variability in the formal modeling of software by using feature selection to transform a delta-oriented base model into a concrete product model. ABS also supports deployment models, with a separation of concerns between execution cost and server capacity. This allows the model-based assessment of deployment choices on a product’s quality of service. This paper combines deployment models with the variability concepts of ABS, to model deployment choices as features when designing a family of products."
