abstract: "Loosely-coupled distributed systems organized as collections of
  so-called cloud-native microservices are able to adapt to traffic in
  very fine-grained and flexible ways.  For this purpose, the
  cloud-native microservices exploit containerization and container
  management systems such as Kubernetes.  This paper presents a formal
  model of resource consumption and scaling for containerized
  microservices deployed and managed by Kubernetes. Our aim is that
  the model, developed in Real-Time ABS, can be used as a framework to
  explore the behavior of deployed systems under various
  configurations at design time---before the systems are actually
  deployed.  We further present initial results comparing the observed
  behavior of instances of our modeling framework to corresponding
  observations of real systems.  These preliminary results suggest
  that the modeling framework can provide a satisfactory accuracy with
  respect to the behavior of distributed microservices managed by
  Kubernetes."
