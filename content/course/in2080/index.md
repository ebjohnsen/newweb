NebulOus is a Horizon Europe project,
funded by the European Commission 2022-2025 (project no 101070516). 

NebulOus will accomplish substantial research contributions in the
realms of cloud and fog computing brokerage by introducing advanced
methods and tools for enabling secure and optimal application
provisioning and reconfiguration over the cloud computing
continuum. NebulOus will develop a novel Meta Operating System and
platform for enabling transient fog brokerage ecosystems that
seamlessly exploit edge and fog nodes, in conjunction with multi-cloud
resources, to cope with the requirements posed by low latency
applications. The envisaged  solution includes the following main
directions of work:<br>
i. Development of appropriate modelling methods and tools for
describing the cloud computing continuum, application requirements,
and data streams; these methods and tools will be used for assuring
the QoS of the provisioned brokered services. <br> 
ii. Efficient comparison of available offerings, using appropriate multi-criteria decision-making methods that are able to consider all dimensions of consumer requirements. <br>
iii. Intelligent applications, workflows and data streams management in the cloud computing continuum. <br>
iv. Addressing in a unified manner the security aspects emerging in of transient cloud computing continuums (e.g., access control, secure network overlay etc.). <br>
v. Conducting and monitoring smart contracts-based service level agreements.
