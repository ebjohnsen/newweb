abstract: "This paper introduces a type system for resource management
in the context of nested virtualization. With nested virtualization,
virtual machines compete with other processes for the resources of
their host environment in order to provision their own processes,
which could again be virtual machines. The calculus of virtually timed
ambients formalizes such resource provisioning, extending the
capabilities of mobile ambients to model the dynamic creation,
migration, and destruction of virtual machines. The proposed type
system is compositional as it uses assumptions about the outside of a
virtually timed ambient to guarantee resource provisioning on the
inside. We prove subject reduction and progress for well-typed
virtually timed ambients, expressing that upper bounds on resource
needs are preserved by reduction and that processes do not run out of
resources."
